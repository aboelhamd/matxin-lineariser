
<h4>Where does the bug with unresolved words come from?</h4>

From sentences with multiple roots. I fixed this in version 7.


<h4>Does version 6 support a language model?</h4>

yes. it does.<br>
The accuracy with a language model on the words forms is 65.39 compared to 58.92 without LM. 
However, since the first word is uppercase, the LM might just be able to figure out which word commes at the beginning of the sentence first.

20.Feb.2012<br>

The linearization syn2lin contains different version, which one is the best? <br>
<ul>
<li> Version 2: older version with less features. 
<li> Version 3: ?
<li> Version 4: more features but no language model (LM); 36000/53.39/38.1 on dev set and 6 iterations 
<li> Version 5: possible LM; 36000/59.55/43.95 on dev set 6 iterations      
<li> Version 6: possible LM; 36000/59.55/43.95 on dev set 6 iterations; difference to 5 unclear
<li> Version 7: LM seems to has a bug. 
</ul>

The best one seems to be version 6.
